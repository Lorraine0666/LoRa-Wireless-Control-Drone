# LoRa-Wireless-Control-Drone

## Introduction

This project involves the design and fabrication of a quadcopter drone equipped with wireless signal transmission via LoRa to control its attitude. The drone's attitude control accuracy is validated using motion capture technology, ensuring precise real-time adjustments and performance evaluation. This system aims to demonstrate the capability of LoRa for long-range wireless communication in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) while leveraging advanced motion capture techniques to improve and verify control precision.
